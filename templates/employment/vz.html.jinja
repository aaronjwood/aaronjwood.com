"Appointed team lead for application security and continuous integration",
"Created an efficient, high performance, highly available Mesos scheduler with support for CNI, distributed storage, and custom executors",
"Built a modular SDK to ease and accelerate the internal development of other Mesos schedulers and executors",

"Created a distributed, self-healing firewall service to dynamically manage netfilter rules/chains across the cluster",
"Developed a load balanced, distributed, self-healing middleman API service which intercepts calls to the logging/monitoring framework to provide a consistent, high performance, database-agnostic interface",
"Worked on a custom deployment/upgrade framework that manages dependencies, provides rollback on failure, supports blue-green deployments, and ensures no downtime of services",
"Wrote a tool to automate the setup, configuration, and deployment of the cluster in a local, virtualized environment"
